## Karl's Advanced Remote Loadout lets you share your weapon and equipment loadouts and gives you deeper insight in the effects of each modification.

This is a fan project and I am not related to Ghost Ship Games or Coffee Stain Publishing. The content and assets used are theirs but should fall under fair use (I hope).

This project is not finished yet but base functionality is there. Any modifications you select will be included in the share-link. The link is copied to your clipboard if you click on “Generate” in the upper right corner. I hope this will make it easier for people giving advice to Greenbeards about how to spec their weapons and equipment.

If you find any bugs or wrong data, please let me know. I would appreciate any ideas for improvement.
